A lightweight PureBYTE Cleaner application written in C for Windows.
It scans a selected folder (and its subfolders) to identify junk files (.tmp, .log, .bak, etc.), displays their details, and allows users to delete them either automatically or manually.

This project demonstrates Windows API usage for file system operations, disk space monitoring, and a user-friendly console interface with smooth loading animations and exit effects.
